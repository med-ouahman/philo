The Producer needs to produce and the consumer needs to consume.
Shared Memory is the solution for this Problem:
To allow producers and consumers to run concurrently, we must have available a buffer of 
items that can be filled by the producer and consumed by the consumer.

This buffer will reside in a region of memory that is shared  by the two processes.



				Two kinds of buffers:

                /-----------------------------------------------\
		|						|
		|						|
		|						|	
		|						|
	Unbounded Buffer				  Bounded Buffer
